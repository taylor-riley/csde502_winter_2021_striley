# Study Overview 

The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 adolescents who were in grades 7-12 during the 1994-95 school year, and have been followed for five waves to date (https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/). This data is from the Add Health Wave 1 data set. 

We will specifically explore poor appetite and depression among adolescents assigned female or male at birth. 



```{r q1, include = F}
### -----------------------------------------------------------

# Create new dataframe 
data_new <- data %>%
  select(aid, bio_sex, h1fs2, h1fs6)


# h1fs2 - You didnâ€™t feel like eating, your appetite was poor.
table(data$h1fs2)
# h1fs6 - You felt depressed.
table(data$h1fs6)


# Set columns to factors

# Descriptive data

The following tables and graphs show the proportion of females and males reporting poor appetite and depression on a Likert scale. 



```{r q2, echo= F, warning = F, message = F}

### Create some frequency tables
#a.	Create a frequency table from each variable, using both counts and percentages.

### Create at least one graph from data in the data frame.

#  Barchart
data_new %>%
  filter(bio_sex != "(6) Refused") %>%
  filter(poor_appetite != "(6) Refused" & poor_appetite != "(8) Don't know") %>% 
ggplot(., aes(x=poor_appetite, fill=bio_sex)) + 
  geom_bar(position="fill")+
  theme_classic()+
  ylab("Percentage")+
  xlab("Reported poor appetite in past week")+
  ggtitle("Figure 1. Proportion reported poor appetite in past week by sex assigned at birth")
